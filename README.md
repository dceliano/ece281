This repository was previously the repo for all of my code in ece281, where all the files were hosted on a private github repo (known as GitLab and run on the servers at USAFA - my folder used to be called myGitLab)).

In this class, we used the Digilent Nexys 2 board with a Xilinx xc3s500e-4fg320 FPGA. In order to program that FPGA, we used Xilinx ISE 14.1 with a JTAG connection. I deleted all the project files, leaving only the source files.
